## **Inspiration**

13 months. 57 weeks. 399 days. These numbers define how long the Coronavirus has been in our lives. 
With the pandemic showing no sign of stopping, the figures continue to increase. The main reason to this unending virus is that there is a lot of disinformation and lack of information going around. 
Especially with teenagers and children, it is hard to inform them about the dangers of going outside and disobeying state regulations. Many want to hang out with their friends, find masks to be uncomfortable, and belittle the effects of the virus. 
Educating them through lessons and talks aren’t ideal methods because a lot of time, kids’ attention spans are quite short. So, we decided to take a different approach with *COVID, Keep Your Distance*.

Through *Covid, Keep Your Distance*, we aspire to combine video games and the current world problem as a means of spreading essential information to those who aren’t well informed, specifically young ones. 
Teaching children through their favorite activity can be an effective solution to raise awareness about the Coronavirus. 


## **What It Does**

*Covid, Keep Your Distance* is a progressive video game aimed at bringing fun and education to the player. 

The game is inspired by our daily lives, with a park as its setting and the player as a character taking a walk. 
The player must avoid the Coronavirus falling from the sky or thrown up, and maintain a “six feet” distance from other characters. Within contact of a virus or a passerby, the game leads the player to a variety of Coronavirus related facts and guidelines.

## **How We Built It**

After a few hours of discussing, we divided ourselves into 2 backend and 1 frontend. 
Naisha and Jocelyn worked on creating the base of the game with Python, and Jenny created the sprites and designs of the game.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**

Our biggest challenge was getting the correct collision of the sprites. There was a confusion of what the x and y coordinates of the text display after the collisions because the alignment was off center and text was surpassing the screen dimension. 
Furthermore, it was actually our first time using Python, so there were a lot of experimenting and researching going on throughout. 

## **What’s Next**
For the second iteration of our informational game, we hope to make it more advanced. As the game is relatively simple, it would be better to add more dynamics, such as power ups and shields, so that the player can have a little more control of the character. 
Furthermore, it would be more interesting to add a storyline to the game and have a final boss in order to maintain a longer play time and thus a more informative game. 
We are also aiming to insert more information into the game and have them vary as the player gets caught so that the player can end the game with a plentiful amount of knowledge.
